# udacitySupervisedLearningProject
Finding donors project from Udacity supervised learning chapter | Data Science Nanodegree

## Elements project
* How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
* How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
* What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
* How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
